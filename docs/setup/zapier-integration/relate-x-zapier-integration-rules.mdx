## Relate x Zapier Integration Rules

### Trigger

Currently, Relate Trigger can create, update, and delete Leads, Contacts, Deals, and Notes.

### Action

Currently, Relate Action can create leads and contacts, and create notes and deals accordingly.

### Custom Webhook

There are some applications that are not directly available in Zapier. However, you can still use Zapier's custom webhook function to integrate.

For related inquiries, please let us know via [we@relate.so](mailto:we@relate.so) or Intercom chat :)

<Warning>

If duplicate Leads/Contacts come into Relate via Zapier as new data, you will receive an email from Zapier stating that an error occurred. Currently, Relate does not allow duplicate data. In this case, you can ignore it, or add the data manually from Relate.

</Warning>
