## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
	<Accordion title="Do I have to create custom fields before importing?">

No. When you import, Relate will automatically create a new custom field that maps your importing data.

Note that in this case, Relate will use text format (string). If you need to use any other formats (e.g., select/multi-select), then you'll need to create custom fields before importing.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I change a custom field's data format when importing?">

We currently support Text, Multi-line text, Select, and Resources:Users data formats when directly creating a custom field while importing.

If you want to use a different data format other than the above, you must create the custom field before importing.

For Resources:Users, you must use the user's email address (e.g., john@doe.com) instead of their name.
