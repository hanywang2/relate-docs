## Lead/Contact Filtering

![Lead Contact Filtering](/docs/images/fundamentals/lead-contact-filtering.png)

\`Filter\` lets you (literally) add filters to your Lead or Contacts list.

For example, you can create a list of leads that you should follow up on this week. To create this, you can apply a filter `Updated at` \+ `is after` \+ `Date`.

![Filter data](/docs/images/fundamentals/filter-date.png)

#### Applying Multiple Filters

When applying more than 1 filter, you can apply one of the two conditions: And / Or.

- `And`: Lead/contact that fulfills both Filter A and Filter B.

- `Or`: Lead/contact that fulfills at least one of the Filter A and Filter B.

## Customize Columns on Lead/Contact Page

![Customize Columns](/docs/images/fundamentals/customize-columns.png)

The Lead/Contact list can be customized by clicking the `Customize columns` button at the top right corner.

- You can change the order between columns

- You can choose to hide/show columns

You can save the arrangement by clicking the `Save as default` button. This customization will be shared with the entire workspace.
