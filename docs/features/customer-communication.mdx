Through Relate, you can manage the entire customer communication and history in one place.

Managing all your customer communication in one place allows your sales reps to generate more leads and close more opportunities. Sales leaders then will be able to understand how their team is performing.

In addition, even non-sales people (Product Manager, Designer, Developer, etc.) can also be in the know with customer communication. They can directly answer questions, discuss sales opportunities with sales reps, and collaborate with team members directly within Relate.



## Communication Timeline

![Communication Timeline](/docs/images/features/communication-timeline.png)

When you go into the Lead Detail page, you can find all your customer interaction history in a timeline format. You can also leave internal comments on the email threads and sales notes found in the timeline.

**I don't see any email in Relate?**

If you do not see any email coming in after adding the contact's email, please check the following:

1. Retrieving your email usually takes only a few seconds, but in some cases, it can take up to 8 hours.

2. Check if your email is connected to Relate.
