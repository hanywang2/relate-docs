Through Relate, you can manage the entire customer communication and history in one place.

Managing all your customer communication in one place allows your sales reps to generate more leads and close more opportunities. Sales leaders then will be able to understand how their team is performing.

In addition, even non-sales people (Product Manager, Designer, Developer, etc.) can also be in the know with customer communication. They can directly answer questions, discuss sales opportunities with sales reps, and collaborate with team members directly within Relate.

## Inbox

Relate's Inbox is the source of truth for customer communication and history. With Inbox, you can manage your customer communication without missing anything.

- Emails (Both Sent & Received)

- Comments from the team

- Notes created by the team

You can use the Inbox as a to-do list since you can get all customer updates here. You can leave items that require additional action in the Inbox. Then, once you're done with them, you can select `Archive` to move them to the Archive tab. You can also `Star` them to pin important items.

### Private Comments on Emails

You can write internal comments on the email threads. These comments are only shared internally and are not included in emails that you send.

<Note>

**Which emails can be seen in Relate?**

Relate pulls any email threads that you sent to/received from your registered contact

Not all emails can be accessed in Relate App. Only the emails registered as contact's email in Relate can be accessed.

## Communication Timeline
