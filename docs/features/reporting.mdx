## Deal Conversion

Deal Conversion gives you the conversion rate when a deal moves from an active status to the next active status or from active to closed (won/lost).

### Win Rate

One of the most important insights you should always check is the Win Rate. How many deals are you actually winning vs. losing? If you know your current Win Rate, you can understand how many deals should be added to your pipeline (on average) to win 1 deal.세일즈 측정할 때 가장 중요한 것은 우리가 파이프라인내에 있는 모든 영업 기회 중에 실제로 몇 개를 수주에 성공하는가? 입니다. 이것을 Win Rate라고 부르는데요.

Win Rate를 알면 자연스럽게 파이프라인에 몇 개의 Deal을 추가해야 하는지도 알 수 있습니다.

For example, in above case your current Win Rate is 50% (4 deals are won out of 8 total). From this information you can find that to win 1 deal, you need to have at least 2 deals in the pipeline.

### Conversion Rate by Status

### Duration of each status
