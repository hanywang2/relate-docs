## Filtering and Sorting

![Lead Contact Filtering](/docs/images/fundamentals/lead-contact-filtering.png)

\`Filter\` lets you (literally) add filters to your Lead or Contacts list.

For example, you can create a list of leads that you should follow up on this week. To create this, you can apply a filter `Updated at` \+ `is after` \+ `Date`.

![Filter data](/docs/images/fundamentals/filter-date.png)

### Where are filters and sorting features located?

Filters and Sort features are located on the top right corner of Organization, People, and Deals Pipeline page.

![Filter location](/docs/images/fundamentals/filter-sort.png)

#### Applying Multiple Filters

When applying more than 1 filter, you can apply one of the two conditions: And / Or.

- `And`: Lead/contact that fulfills both Filter A and Filter B.

- `Or`: Lead/contact that fulfills at least one of the Filter A and Filter B.

## Data Views

![views](/docs/images/fundamentals/views.png)

Relate lets you save Filters and Sorting options as "Views." You can use these Views as presets.

![save views](/docs/images/fundamentals/save-views.png)

(1) To create a View, first use the Filter and Sort feature to add filter/sort conditions. Then, click `Save as Data view` button to create a new View.

(2) Give the View a name, then choose whether you'll share this View within the workspace.

(3) Click `Create Data view` to save.

<Tip>

Data Views are available for Organization, People, and Deal Pipeline pages.
