## What is Inbound Sales?

Inbound sales is a sales strategy and process in which the potential customers start the relationship. Inbound sales teams focus on their customers’ pain points rather than focusing just on the selling.

## Inbound Sales Process

A potential customer will go through three main stages when purchasing a product or service through inbound sales motion.

1. Awareness: The potential buyer identifies a challenge, an opportunity, or a goal they need to achieve. They learn more about the problem and become aware of your product through channels such as:

- Product sign-ups (free trial/freemium)
- Blog Posts
- White papers
- Demo videos
- Word-of-mouth

2. Consideration: The potential buyer is now aware of their problem and has determined to solve it. The buyer would evaluate various ways to solve their problem. During the considerations stage, the buyer may reach out for more information regarding your solution.

3. Decision: The buyer has decided on a solution strategy, method, or approach. But they are still deciding which specific product or service to use. They will consider whether your product is right for them before making a final purchase decision.
