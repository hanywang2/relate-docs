## Overview

Upsell and cross-sell are two ways to generate additional revenue from customers. Let's look at upsell and cross-sell and how to do them. 

## Upsell

An upsell is when you generate more revenue by upgrading to a more premium product. . It's selling a higher-priced product with more features. 

For example, getting a customer on a $30/User/Month plan to move up to a $50/User/Month plan. 

To upsell, you need to make sure that the customer is happy with their existing product, and you need to be able to convince them that they will get more value from using the more expensive product. 

## Cross-Sell

A cross-sell is when you sell customers other products they aren't using.

For example, if a customer only uses Product A, you might want them to try Product B, which can be used with Product A to create synergy. 

To cross-sell, you need to convince them how the additional product they're buying will create more value with the existing product.
