## What Is Lead Qualification?

Lead Qualification is the process of determining which potential customers are most likely to make a final purchase and ultimately become a customer. It is a vital responsibility of account executives and B2B marketers as it evaluates the likelihood of the prospect’s willingness to engage in a new business relationship. 

If you want to accurately dissect the customer’s buying power, you have to ask specific qualification questions. Consequently, the objective of the dialogue is to understand their current needs. The more you grasp the customer’s needs, the better chance you have in selling the product and understanding your customer segment.
