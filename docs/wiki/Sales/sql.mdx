## What is a Sales Qualified Lead (SQL)?

A Sales Qualified Lead is a lead qualified through the sales team. SQLs are typically passed through [Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs)](https://www.relate.so/docs/wiki/mql) and [Product Qualified Leads (PQLs)](https://www.relate.so/docs/wiki/pql).

SQLs are viewed as prospects with solid sales opportunities and ready to be contacted by salespeople directly. Usually, [AEs](https://www.relate.kr/docs/wiki/sales-roles#account-executive-ae) are responsible to work with SQLs to close deals and generate revenues. 

SQLs typically have the following characteristics:

1. Interest: SQLs are interested in your product or service, often gathered through a marketing campaign.
2. Needs: SQLs often have a problem or need related to your product or service.
3. Budget: SQLs have a budget to purchase the product or service and are likely to be the person with purchasing decision authority.
4. Purchasing decision: To make a purchasing decision, the SQLs will likely speak directly with the sales team and request more information about the product or service.

Managing SQLs are one of the most important activities in the sales process.
