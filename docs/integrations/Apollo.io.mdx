# Overview
Apollo is a lead generation and email sequencing software for B2B companies. It offers a free tier so you can get started with Apollo right away.

## Use Apollo with Relate CRM
Apollo has some great features on the lead generation and outbound email side of things.

Here are our team's favorite ways to integrate Apollo with Relate:

- Automatically sync your Apollo lead lists with Relate
- Sync any emails sent/received through Apollo

## Connect Apollo and Relate through Zapier

### 1. Create a Zap linking Apollo and Relate
First, you'd need a Zapier account and a Zap linking between Relate and Apollo.

Find Apollo and Relate from the first page you see after logging into Zapier. In the second row, choose “New Contact” from Apollo and “Generate Lead & Contact” from Relate.

With this integration, saving a new contact in Apollo will automatically create a new lead and contact in Relate. 

Click the “Try it!” button to continue.

### Set up Zapier Trigger and Action

![apollo_6](/docs/images/integrations/apollo_6.png)

Once you add your API keys to Zapier, it will take you to next steps -- Trigger and Action.

In the Trigger section, click the “Test trigger” button to test Apollo account connection. 

**Note that you'll need to have at least one contact added to Apollo.**

If the test is successful, move on to the Action section.

![apollo_7](/docs/images/integrations/apollo_7.png)

In the Action section, test Relate connection first. Then, go to the “Set up action” and match customer information with data fields in Relate.

There are three required data fields. 
- Company Name
- Contact Name
- Contact Email

If some of the customer information don’t match the data field in Relate, you can add them in the **Note** section. This will create a note in Relate with the customer information you choose.

If you're using Note section, Relate will also send a notification in your Inbox whenever there's a new contact added to Relate. You can then use it as a reminder that a new contact has been created.  

#### Automatically create a new deal
To automatically create a new corresponding deal, you need to add information in the Deal section. (e.g., Deal Assignee, Deal Status, etc.)

![apollo_8](/docs/images/integrations/apollo_8.png)

If you leave the Deal section blank, it won’t create a new deal. 


### Publish the Zap
Lastly, click the “Test action” button to test, and publish the Zap. You can change the name of the Zap in the top left corner.
