## Organization Status

![organization-status](/docs/images/changelog/organization-status.png)

Organization Status is a valuable tool that lets you see the current relationship with a customer or prospect. Do they need to be nurtured? Do they qualify your business? Are they already a customer? Have they churned?

You can answer these questions by tracking each company’s current Organization Status in Relate.

A company’s status can be captured by using any of the below statuses in Relate:
- **Unidentified**: Companies that have yet to be identified as either Potential, Qualified, Customer, etc.
- **Potential**: Companies that seem to have the potential to become your customer. An SDR will therefore engage with them to find out.
- **Qualifying**: Companies that your sales team is currently qualifying.
- **Closing**: Qualified companies that are in talks with your sales team to purchase the product.
- **Customer**: Customers who have successfully signed contract/paid subscription invoices, and now using your product.
-** Nurturing**: Companies you evaluate as an ICP but need to nurture as they either don’t have a budget yet, think that this is not a priority, etc.
- **Bad Fit**: Companies that turn out to be unfit for your product.
- **Churned**: Companies that have churned and are no longer paying.

Sales teams can determine each company's current relationship stage and prioritize.

We designed the Organization Status to cover your sales process end-to-end, from prospecting leads to customer success. See below diagram for a visualization of how Relate Sales Process works.

Note that Organization Status is a default field, which means you cannot edit its field name, type, etc.
