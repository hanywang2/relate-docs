## Overview

You can now manage Zapier integrations via Relate app settings page. This allows you to see which Zaps are currently live and which apps aren't from a single screen. You can also browse Zap templates you can use to improve and automate your workflow.

To get started, simply go to your [app settings page](https://app.relate.so/) and click `Integrations` tab, then click `Zapier`.

## Fixes and Improvements
- You can now use `Organization Status` and `Organization Assignee` in Zapier triggers and actions. This allows you to specify organization status and assignees for each trigger and action.
- Fixed a bug where Organization, People, and Deal lists automatically resizes
- Fixed a bug where deal card modal pops up when you access the Organization detail page from the Pipeline view.
