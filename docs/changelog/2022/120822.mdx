## Overview

You can now manage Zapier integrations via Relate app settings page. This allows you to see which Zaps are currently live and which apps aren't from a single screen. You can also browse Zap templates you can use to improve and automate your workflow.

To get started, simply go to your [app settings page](https://app.relate.so/) and click `Integrations` tab, then click `Zapier`.
