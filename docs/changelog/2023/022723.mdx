## Multi-pipeline

![multi-pipeline](/docs/images/changelog/multi-pipeline.png)

We've added a multi-pipeline feature for teams with various use cases when managing their customers and ongoing sales deals.

The multi-pipeline feature can be helpful if you:
- Have multiple products to sell, and each product effectively has a different sales process.
- Want to try and experiment with different sales processes but keep the current process.
- Have services business as well as a product business (services such as consulting, implementation, etc. can have longer sales processes)

However, we recommend sticking with one sales pipeline if you want to do the following:
- Create multiple pipelines for each industry, geography/region, segment, size, type of customer, etc. ðŸ‘‰ We recommend using [Custom Fields](https://www.relate.so/docs/features/custom-fields) + [Data Views](https://www.relate.so/docs/features/filtering-views#data-views) to track them in a single pipeline.
- Create multiple pipelines for each sales rep ðŸ‘‰ Relate already has [Deal Assignee](https://www.relate.so/docs/features/deal-pipeline) feature, so you can use them with [Data Views](https://www.relate.so/docs/features/filtering-views#data-views) to create separate views for each rep!

## File Attachment

![file attachment email](/docs/images/changelog/file-attachment-email.png)

You can now attach files to email drafts in Relate. It works the same way as other popular email clients such as Gmail and Outlook -- click `Attach file` to upload files (up to 25mb) to the draft.

## Reporting direct link

![reporting-link](/docs/images/changelog/reporting-link.png)

Each workspace in Relate now has a direct link to the Reporting page. To access the Reporting page, click the ellipsis (`...`) on each workspace tab and click `Reporting`.

We will be completely revamping our reporting and analytics features very soon! We will keep you posted.

## Fixes and Improvements
- Relate now remembers your last app size even after re-opening the app.
- Fixed an issue where deal detail modal does not load in Deal List View.
- Fixed an issue where certain emails would not appear on Organization Detail Page.
- Fixed a problem with opening URLs in Relate app
- Fixed an issue where the Task feature does not work correctly when a task is assigned to an unconfirmed user
