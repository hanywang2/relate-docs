## Overview

Relate got a new branding, new landing page, and made a few quality of life improvements.

## Rebranding

![rebranding](/docs/images/changelog/rebranding.png)

Introducing newly refreshed Relate brand üíô

Our new branding reflects our goal of making B2B sales more relatable, helping businesses build stronger customer relationships.

In creating our new brand, our goal was to design a logo that exudes friendliness and approachability.

We drew inspiration from the proportional symbol "‚àù," which represents the concept of relation in mathematics, as well as the letter "r" in the alphabet.

## Landing Page Renewal
