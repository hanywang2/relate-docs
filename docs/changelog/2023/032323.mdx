## Overview

We’ve added fresh new “quality of life” updates that will make your sales + customer success even better.

-   We made our app load much faster! 🏎️
-   We added a loading spinner ꩜
-   We added a .CSV export button in the People list
-   We added the “Status Updated At” filter/sorting
-   We made the Org/People list UX better
-   Fixed a bug where Organization logos weren’t displayed even if the Organization had a URL or had a person with a proper email address.

### Load Relate faster

We made quality-of-life improvements to the way Relate loads your customer data. You should be able to navigate in Relate much faster!

We’ve also added a small loading spinner to indicate whether any changes you made are still “work-in-progress.”

### CSV export button

### Status Updated At Sort/Filter

`Status Updated At` is an excellent addition to our sorters/filters. It lets you sort/filter by any status changes to each Organization.
