## Overview

![email-template](/docs/images/changelog/email-template.png)

Templates are one of the easiest ways to make your sales + customer success activities faster. Templates will let you save any email messages you use repeatedly and share them with your team.

Relate now can do this! You can now use email templates to draft and share a message with your team quickly.

We've also updated the way Inbox notifications work in Relate.


## Email Templates

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "69.74664679582713%",
    height: 0,
  }}
>
  <iframe
    src="https://www.loom.com/embed/9694f5d5d7df4efd8ca3a5148fe230e6"
    frameborder="0"
    webkitAllowFullScreen
    mozallowFullScreen
    allowFullScreen
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
    }}
  ></iframe>
</div>


To get started:

1. Go to the Organization page.
2. Compose a new email or reply to an existing email thread. You will now see the `Use template` button on your draft.
3. Click this button to create a new template or edit/delete.

Note that your templates will be shared with other workspace members.

Early access customers can set up an unlimited amount of templates!

### Inbox notifications overhaul

![inbox-overhaul](/docs/images/changelog/inbox-overhaul.png)

Relate's inbox system now notifies you at the Organization-level. This means you will be notified of any updates to each Organization. See below the list of all of the items that the Inbox will notify:

- New email received/sent
- New note created
- New comment
- New deal created
- Deal updated

Note that we currently don't show the actual deal information in the Inbox for deals. We'll work on displaying deal information soon!
